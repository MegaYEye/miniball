  \brief Power reference module for the CC430F6137 and CC430F6147.
  
  Previously, we used the built-in power request features of the ADC12
  in the CC430F6137, but this is bad for two reasons.  First, the
  ADC10 in the '6147 lacks power requests, and second, there are more
  efficient power modes that might reduce the current consumption of
  our LCD charge pump.
